Approach 1 - The doubleL function initialises a blank list called res with an integer n as input. Subsequently, iterating through a range of 0 to n-1, it adds each doubled value of i to the res list. The res list is finally returned by the function. Another loop in the main function prints, using a colon as a separator, each entry in the list returned by doubleL(5).

Approach 2 - A list comprehension [n * 2 for n in range(5)] is used in this method. It creates a new list containing the doubled values of integers 0 through 4 after iterating through a range of 0 to 4 (inclusive). Then, as iterating through this list, the main function appends a colon separator to each element.

Approach 3 - When given an integer n as input, the doubleG function functions as a generator. This is accomplished by using a for loop to iteratively traverse a range from 0 to n-1, doubling the value of i each time and producing the desired outcome. The generator function can pause its state between calls and return values one at a time in a lazy manner because of the yield keyword. The given values are written with a colon separator after doubleG(5) is called repeatedly in the main code.
